  <h1> Hello World </h1>

  <p><em>Welcome to the first HTML page we published as students
      at <a href="https://epicodus.com">Epicodus<a/>! It is unstyled
      because we have not learned CSS yet.</p>
  
    <p><a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming-part-time-react-track/git-html-and-css/practice-tracking-changes-with-git">Here
  is the lesson</a> from <a href="https://learnhowtoprogram.com">our
  curriculum</a> where we made this page on Monday January 3rd
  2022. The index.html, README, LICENSE, and Github Pages deployment
  were added later that week. We've also retained the
  original <a href="hello-world.html">hello-world.html</a> file. We
  hope you enjoy it and that you'll checkout more of our work

<h2> A program to greet the planet. </h2>

<p>This page is an attempt to greet everyone on Earth using our various human languages.  We're interested to see how long our list can become. </p>

<p>We'll start with languages that the Epicodus staff could offer without using Google. </p>

<ul>
  <li> English: Hello, world! </li>
  <li> Spanish:  Hola, mundo! </li>
  <li> Japanese: Konnichiwa, sekai! </li>
  <li> French: Bonjour, monde! </li>
  <li> Kinyarwanda: Mwirwe, isi! </li>
  <li> German: Guten tag, Welt! </li>
  <li> Pig Latin: ello-hay, orld-way! </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is some other text to go along with it.</p>
